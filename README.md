# Kaggle-Beginner-Competitions
This is a github repository that I am using for storing the different beginner Kaggle competition codebases . Beginner competitions can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?hostSegmentIdFilter=5 .

# Description
This project aims to serve as a learning experience and representation of what I have and continue to learn. Also almost all, if not all, of this project will be done in Python. I will be adding as I continuously work on this in my free time. 

# Acknowledgement
I would like to thank Kaggle and everyone on Kaggle that provides these great datasets and challenges! Thank you for furthering the future of Machine Learning researchers.
